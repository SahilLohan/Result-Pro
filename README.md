This Project is about creating a desktop application using java Swing and AWT 

I have used a local database to develop the  program.
All media like gif and logos are saved in my own local machine.

To run this program on your machine ....
1. Setup the database and then execute queries in java programs accordingly.
2. change path of media according to your needs. 
3. To execute JDBC commands. Download mysql-connector Jar file and then set-up the class path.
